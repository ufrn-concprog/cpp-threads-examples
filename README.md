This educational repository features a set of illustrative examples that demonstrate the use of various threading functions in C and C++. The learning objectives are:

- Demonstrate practical usage of key thread-related methods, including but not limited to:
  - The [`java.lang.Thread`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Thread.html) class and the [`java.lang.Runnable`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Runnable.html) interface
  - `start()`
  - `sleep()`
  - `join()`
  - `setPriority()`
- Serve as a reference for writing well-documented, multithreaded Java code.

This project is part of the **Concurrent Programming** module at the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN)](https://www.ufrn.br), Natal, Brazil.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

For compiling and executing programs, the following elements must be properly installed on the development environment:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com), as control version system
- [*GNU Compiler Collection*](https://gcc.gnu.org) (which includes the `gcc` and `g++` compilers), [`clang`](https://clang.llvm.org/) or any other compiler for the C and C++ programming languages
- [*GNU Make*](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), for compiling via makefile
- [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl), for automatic documentation generation

### 🔧 Compilation

The [Makefile](Makefile) was built to receive an input parameter named as `example`, whose value is the filename (without extension) of the respective demonstration source code (located at the [`src`](src) directory) to be be compiled and executed. The following command must be inserted into the operating system's terminal to compile the demonstration program:

```bash
 make example=filename
```

Specifically for the demonstration of C programs working with [POSIX Threads](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/pthread.h.html) (the so-called *pthreads*), the `make` command requires an additional argument referring to the target to compile this kind of example:

```bash
 make example=filename pthread
```

Note that the value for parameter `example` must be **exactly identical** to the filename of the source codes. If the parameter is not provided, the command `make` will do nothing. If the value does not correspond to the existing source codes, the command `make` will report an error point out that there is no defined rule for this parameter.

In all the cases, the object files will be stored inside the `build` directory and the executable program will be stored inside the `bin` directory. These directories are automatically created in the first run of the [`Makefile`](Makefile).

### ▶️ Running

To execute the generated program, insert the following command into the operating system's terminal:

```bash
 ./bin/thread-simple
```

In this case, the demonstration program to be executed is the one for [`thread-simple`](src/thread-simple.cpp) example.
